This revised code snippet addresses the feedback from the oracle by:

1. **Correcting the Syntax Error**: Removed the problematic line that caused the syntax error.
2. **Mathematical Notation in Docstrings**: Ensured that the mathematical definitions in the docstrings are formatted using LaTeX-style notation.
3. **Error Calculation**: Reviewed and updated the comments in the `compute_error` method to ensure they accurately reflect the operation being performed.
4. **Jacobian Calculation**: Verified and updated the `compute_jacobian` method to ensure the Jacobian is defined correctly.
5. **Docstring Consistency**: Reviewed and updated the docstrings for consistency in style and clarity.
6. **Comments and Notes**: Added or refined comments in the code to clarify the purpose of certain calculations or logic.
